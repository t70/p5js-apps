QR Code Scanner
---------------

Once I used @zxing/ngx-scanner (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zxing/ngx-scanner) and it worked fine. See demo here (https://zxing-js.github.io/ngx-scanner/).

Easy to use:

<!-- some.component.html -->
<zxing-scanner></zxing-scanner>
Install: npm i @zxing/ngx-scanner
